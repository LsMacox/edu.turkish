My personal experience as a student and many years of living in Turkey help me better understand the needs and difficulties of international students.\n\nMy goal is to make the process of admission and full settlement as easy and simple as possible: From choosing a university to processing all necessary documents and adapting in Turkey. I strive to provide only up-to-date information and accompany students at every stage of their journey."

In my work, I focus on responsibility, attention to detail, and high-quality support so that every student feels support and confidence in a new country. In addition to consulting activities, I am actively interested in issues of intercultural adaptation and international education, which helps me even better understand the needs of students and find the right solutions for them."

While the team helps with the choice of university and adaptation, I help by ensuring that everything \"inside\" the site works as it should.\n\nI believe that a good system is one that you don't even think about because it just works. That's what I strive for every day."

I study at İstanbul Aydın Üniversitesi in the Graphic Design faculty — I chose this major because I am close to art, I love to create, visualize ideas, and express myself through design.\n\nMy path to studying in Turkey was not easy: I went through all the stages of admission and preparation, faced difficulties and even fraudsters, which is why I had to do everything again — collect documents, look for a new company, and organize the move myself. Once there, I solved all the issues myself: from obtaining a residence permit to finding housing. This experience taught me a lot — independence, responsibility, and self-belief.\n\nNow I share my knowledge and experience of living and studying in Turkey on our social networks. I tell honestly and openly about all the difficulties and pros to help others avoid mistakes and inspire them not to be afraid to pursue their goals."
