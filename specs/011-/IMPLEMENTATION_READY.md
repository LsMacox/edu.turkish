# ✅ Implementation Plan Complete - Enhanced Service Pages

**Feature**: Enhanced Service Pages for Document Translation  
**Branch**: `011-`  
**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## 📋 Summary

The implementation planning phase for enhancing service pages is complete. All design artifacts, contracts, and documentation have been generated and are ready for development.

### What This Feature Does

Enhances the existing service pages (particularly document translation) by:

1. **Adding delivery timeframes** to service cards (e.g., "Срок: 1–2 дня")
2. **Creating "How It Works" section** with 3-4 illustrated process steps
3. **Creating "Why Choose Us" section** with 3 trust factors
4. **Adding trust indicator badges** throughout the page ("Working since 2019", "1000+ documents")
5. **Improving intro block content** to be more engaging and service-oriented

## 🚀 Getting Started

**For Developers Ready to Implement:**

1. **Read the Quickstart Guide**:

   ```bash
   cat specs/011-/quickstart.md
   ```

2. **Review Contracts**:

   ```bash
   cat specs/011-/contracts/types.ts
   cat specs/011-/contracts/component-props.ts
   ```

3. **Start with Phase 1**:
   - Follow quickstart.md Phase 1 instructions
   - Add delivery timeframes to SubServiceCard
   - Test and validate

4. **Continue Through Phases**:
   - Complete each phase in order
   - Run tests after each phase
   - Validate translations for all 4 locales

5. **Final Validation**:
   ```bash
   pnpm i18n:check      # Verify all translations present
   pnpm typecheck       # Verify type safety
   pnpm lint            # Verify code quality
   pnpm test            # Run test suite
   ```

## 🎓 Key Patterns to Follow

### Component Design

- Atomic components with single responsibility
- Props for data, slots for composition
- Accessibility-first (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### i18n Integration

- All text content externalized to JSON files
- Support all 4 locales (ru, en, tr, kk)
- Structured nested format for organization

### Styling Approach

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Tailwind utility classes
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Subtle hover/transition effects

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for page rendering
- Accessibility validation
- Visual regression (manual)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No Backend Changes Required** - This is purely frontend enhancement
2. **No Database Migrations** - Content is managed via i18n JSON files
3. **Backward Compatible** - New sections are additive, existing functionality preserved
4. **Translation Workflow** - Russian content first, then professional translation to EN/TR/KK
5. **Gradual Rollout** - Can implement one service page at a time for testing
