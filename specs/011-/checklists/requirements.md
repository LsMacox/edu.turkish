# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Service Pages for Document Translation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Date**: 2025-10-12

### Content Quality Review

- ✅ Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
- ✅ Focus remains on user value (reducing anxiety, increasing transparency, building trust)
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review

- ✅ No clarification markers needed - requirements are specific and actionable
- ✅ All functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-003 can be verified by checking if delivery timeframe appears under price)
- ✅ Success criteria include quantitative metrics (40% reduction in inquiries, 25% increase in time spent, 15% conversion lift)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "users can understand" rather than "page loads X components")
- ✅ Each user story includes specific acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Edge cases identified for variable timeframes, process variations, and content updates
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly bounds what is NOT included
- ✅ Assumptions section documents all presumptions made during specification

### Feature Readiness Review

- ✅ Each functional requirement can be independently verified
- ✅ User scenarios prioritized (2 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3) and independently testable
- ✅ Success criteria provide clear definition of done
- ✅ Specification remains implementation-agnostic throughout

**Overall Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).
