# Tasks: Enhanced Service Pages for Document Translation

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/specs/011-/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ, quickstart.md ‚úÖ

**Tests**: Included - Feature spec includes acceptance scenarios for each user story

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

**Project Type**: Nuxt 3 Web Application (SSR)

- Components: `app/components/`
- Pages: `app/pages/`
- Types: `app/types/`
- i18n: `i18n/locales/{locale}/services/`
- Tests: `tests/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and shared TypeScript types

- [x] T001 [P] Add new TypeScript interfaces to `app/types/services.ts` (ProcessStep, TrustFactor, TrustIndicator, SubServiceWithDelivery)
- [x] T002 [P] SKIPPED - Using existing services.json structure instead of subdirectories
- [x] T003 [P] SKIPPED - Using existing services.json structure instead of subdirectories
- [x] T004 [P] SKIPPED - Using existing services.json structure instead of subdirectories
- [x] T005 [P] SKIPPED - Using existing services.json structure instead of subdirectories

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core i18n content and shared component foundation that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Create baseline common section in `i18n/locales/ru/services.json` with deliveryTime label
- [x] T007 [P] Create baseline common section in `i18n/locales/en/services.json` with deliveryTime label
- [x] T008 [P] Create baseline common section in `i18n/locales/tr/services.json` with deliveryTime label
- [x] T009 [P] Create baseline common section in `i18n/locales/kk/services.json` with deliveryTime label
- [x] T010 Run `pnpm i18n:check` to validate baseline translations

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quick Service Understanding (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can immediately see service offerings, pricing, and delivery timeframes in an engaging intro block

**Independent Test**: Navigate to any service page, verify service cards display name, description, price, and "–°—Ä–æ–∫: X‚ÄìY –¥–Ω–µ–π" below price. Verify intro block text is engaging and service-oriented.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Each service card displays delivery timeframe consistently formatted below pricing
2. Intro block communicates value and approachability rather than dry instructions

### Tests for User Story 1

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Can proceed in parallel if staffed (US1, US2, US3, US4 are independent)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, but naturally builds on US1 layout
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, integrates into same layout as US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent, decorative elements

**Note**: While user stories can technically proceed in parallel, sequential implementation in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4) is recommended for this feature due to shared ServicePageLayout modifications.

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Components before page integration
- i18n content for all 4 locales together
- Validation after each sub-task group
- Manual testing before moving to next story

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Within Phase 1**: All setup tasks (T001-T005) can run in parallel
- **Within Phase 2**: i18n baseline files (T007-T009) can run in parallel after T006
- **Within Each User Story**:
  - Component creation tasks marked [P] can run together
  - i18n content for different locales marked [P] can run together
  - Service page updates marked [P] can run together
  - Test file creation marked [P] can run together
- **Across User Stories**: If multiple developers available, each can own one user story after Foundational phase completes

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for SubServiceCard with deliveryTime prop"
Task: "Integration test for service page rendering with delivery times"

# After tests fail, launch component modifications in parallel:
# (Note: SubServiceCard is single file, so T013-T014 are sequential, but i18n can be parallel)

# Launch all i18n additions for deliveryTime in parallel:
Task: "Add deliveryTime to ru/services/document-translations.json"
Task: "Add deliveryTime to en/services/document-translations.json"
Task: "Add deliveryTime to tr/services/document-translations.json"
Task: "Add deliveryTime to kk/services/document-translations.json"

# Launch all service page updates in parallel:
Task: "Update document-translations.vue to pass deliveryTime"
Task: "Update relocation-in-turkey.vue to pass deliveryTime"
Task: "Update turkish-english-course.vue to pass deliveryTime"
Task: "Update tr-yos-courses.vue to pass deliveryTime"
Task: "Update sat-courses.vue to pass deliveryTime"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch component creation in parallel:
Task: "Create ProcessStep component"
Task: "Create HowItWorksSection component"

# Launch all i18n additions in parallel:
Task: "Add howItWorks to ru/services/common.json"
Task: "Add howItWorks to en/services/common.json"
Task: "Add howItWorks to tr/services/common.json"
Task: "Add howItWorks to kk/services/common.json"

# Launch all service page integrations in parallel:
Task: "Add HowItWorksSection to document-translations.vue"
Task: "Add HowItWorksSection to relocation-in-turkey.vue"
Task: "Add HowItWorksSection to turkish-english-course.vue"
Task: "Add HowItWorksSection to tr-yos-courses.vue"
Task: "Add HowItWorksSection to sat-courses.vue"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + User Story 2 - Both P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T010) - **CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T031)
4. **CHECKPOINT**: Test US1 independently - users can see delivery times
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T032-T050)
6. **CHECKPOINT**: Test US1+US2 together - users see times and process
7. Deploy/demo if ready - **This is your MVP!**

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (~1-2 hours)
2. User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~2-3 hours)
3. User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~4-5 hours)
4. User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~3-4 hours)
5. User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo** (~2 hours)
6. Polish ‚Üí Final QA ‚Üí **Production Release**

**Total estimated effort**: 11-14 hours implementation + 2-3 hours testing/polish = **13-17 hours**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2 developers after Foundational phase:

**Scenario A: Sequential (Recommended for this feature)**

- Developer A: Complete US1, then US3
- Developer B: Complete US2, then US4
- Reason: Shared ServicePageLayout modifications are easier to manage sequentially

**Scenario B: Parallel (If team is experienced with git conflicts)**

- Developer A: Complete US1 + US2 (P1 priorities)
- Developer B: Complete US3 + US4 (P2, P3 priorities)
- Coordinate ServicePageLayout changes carefully

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 100 tasks across 7 phases

**Task Distribution by Phase**:

- Phase 1 (Setup): 5 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 5 tasks
- Phase 3 (User Story 1 - P1): 21 tasks
- Phase 4 (User Story 2 - P1): 19 tasks
- Phase 5 (User Story 3 - P2): 19 tasks
- Phase 6 (User Story 4 - P3): 17 tasks
- Phase 7 (Polish): 14 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 64 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel with other [P] tasks

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- US1: Service cards show delivery times and engaging intro
- US2: "How it works" section displays with 4 steps
- US3: "Why choose us" section displays with 3 factors
- US4: Trust indicators appear naturally positioned

**Suggested MVP**: Complete through Phase 4 (User Stories 1 & 2) - **Both are P1 priority**

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests must FAIL before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after completing each user story phase
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- i18n validation is critical - run `pnpm i18n:check` frequently
- Manual responsive testing required - automated visual regression is optional
- All 5 service pages must be updated consistently for each user story
