## 🚀 Recommended Execution Strategy

### MVP First (Fastest Path to Value)

```
1. Phase 1: Setup (5 tasks, 30 min)
   └─ Add TypeScript types and i18n directory structure

2. Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks, 1 hour) ⚠️ CRITICAL BLOCKER
   └─ Create baseline i18n content for all locales

3. Phase 3: User Story 1 (21 tasks, 2-3 hours) 🎯
   └─ Add delivery timeframes to service cards
   └─ CHECKPOINT: Test independently, deploy if ready

4. Phase 4: User Story 2 (19 tasks, 4-5 hours)
   └─ Add "How it works" section
   └─ CHECKPOINT: Test independently, deploy MVP!

STOP HERE FOR MVP → Both P1 priorities complete
Total MVP time: 7.5-10.5 hours
```

### Full Feature (All User Stories)

```
Continue from MVP:

5. Phase 5: User Story 3 (19 tasks, 3-4 hours)
   └─ Add "Why choose us" section
   └─ CHECKPOINT: Test independently, deploy

6. Phase 6: User Story 4 (17 tasks, 2 hours)
   └─ Add trust indicator badges
   └─ CHECKPOINT: Test independently, deploy

7. Phase 7: Polish (14 tasks, 2-3 hours)
   └─ Cross-cutting concerns, final QA
   └─ Production release

Total time: 13-17 hours
```

## ⚡ Parallelization Opportunities

**64 tasks marked [P]** can run in parallel when conditions allow:

### Example: User Story 1 Parallelization

```bash
# i18n content (4 locales) - can all run in parallel:
✓ T015 [P] Add deliveryTime to ru/document-translations.json
✓ T016 [P] Add deliveryTime to en/document-translations.json
✓ T017 [P] Add deliveryTime to tr/document-translations.json
✓ T018 [P] Add deliveryTime to kk/document-translations.json

# Service page updates - can all run in parallel:
✓ T019 [P] Update document-translations.vue
✓ T020 [P] Update relocation-in-turkey.vue
✓ T021 [P] Update turkish-english-course.vue
✓ T022 [P] Update tr-yos-courses.vue
✓ T023 [P] Update sat-courses.vue
```

### Multi-Developer Strategy

**With 2 developers** after Foundational phase:

**Option A (Sequential - Recommended)**:

- Developer A: US1 → US3 (P1 + P2)
- Developer B: US2 → US4 (P1 + P3)
- Benefit: Easier coordination on ServicePageLayout

**Option B (Parallel - Experienced Teams)**:

- Developer A: US1 + US2 (Both P1 - MVP)
- Developer B: US3 + US4 (P2 + P3)
- Benefit: Faster MVP delivery
- Caution: Requires careful git coordination

## ✅ Quality Checkpoints

Each user story phase ends with validation:

### After Each User Story:

1. ✓ `pnpm i18n:check` - All translations present
2. ✓ `pnpm typecheck` - TypeScript correctness
3. ✓ `pnpm test` - Unit tests pass
4. ✓ Manual testing - Visual validation on 3 breakpoints
5. ✓ Independent test - Story works without other stories

### Before Production (Phase 7):

1. ✓ Full test suite
2. ✓ Accessibility audit
3. ✓ Cross-browser testing
4. ✓ Performance validation
5. ✓ SEO validation
6. ✓ All 4 locales verified

---

## 📋 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Tests are included** and follow TDD approach:

```
For each user story:
1. Write tests FIRST (marked with task ID)
2. Run tests → Verify they FAIL
3. Implement feature
4. Run tests → Verify they PASS
5. Refactor if needed
```

**Test Coverage**:

- ✅ Unit tests for all 5 new components
- ✅ Unit tests for 2 modified components
- ✅ Integration tests for service page rendering
- ✅ Accessibility tests (Phase 7)
- ✅ Visual regression tests (Phase 7, optional)

## 🎯 Success Criteria Tracking

After deployment, measure these metrics (from spec.md):

| Metric                      | Target      | How to Measure               |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Page comprehension time     | ≤45 seconds | User testing/analytics       |
| Section scroll-through rate | ≥80%        | Scroll depth tracking        |
| Support inquiry reduction   | -40%        | Compare 30 days before/after |
| Time on page increase       | +25%        | Google Analytics             |
| Conversion rate increase    | +15%        | Form submission tracking     |
| User confidence             | ≥90%        | Post-interaction survey      |

## 🎓 Key Principles

1. **TDD Approach**: Tests first, watch them fail, implement, watch them pass
2. **Independent Stories**: Each user story should work without others
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Deploy after each story for continuous value
4. **i18n First**: All content in JSON files, 4 locales always
5. **Mobile First**: Responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, semantic HTML
7. **No New Dependencies**: Uses existing project infrastructure

---

## ⚠️ Critical Blockers

**Phase 2 (Foundational) MUST complete before ANY user story work begins**

Tasks T006-T010 create baseline i18n structure needed by all user stories.

Do not start Phase 3 until Phase 2 is complete and validated with `pnpm i18n:check`.

You now have:

- ✅ 100 actionable tasks organized by user story
- ✅ Clear dependencies and execution order
