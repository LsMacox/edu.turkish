# Tasks: Enhanced Service Page Content Blocks

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-x-30-60/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Nuxt 3 web application structure
- Components: `app/components/features/services/sections/`
- Pages: `app/pages/services/`
- i18n: `i18n/locales/{en,ru,kk,tr}/services.json`
- Tests: `tests/components/features/services/sections/`, `tests/contract/`
- Types: `app/types/services.ts`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
  - US2 (P1): Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
  - US3 (P1): Can start after Phase 2 - Reuses components from US2 but can develop in parallel
  - US4 (P2): Can start after Phase 2 - Reuses some components from US1/US2
  - US5 (P3): Can start after Phase 2 - Independent components
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Creates 6 new components
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Creates 5 new components + reuses 1 from US1
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Reuses all components from US2, only needs i18n
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Creates 2 new components + reuses 4 from US1/US2
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Creates 3 new components, independent

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Components can be created in parallel (marked [P])
- i18n keys must be added to English first, then copied to other locales
- Page integration happens after components and i18n are ready
- Manual testing verifies story completion

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks (T001-T003) can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks (T004-T006) can run in parallel
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All component tests within a story can run in parallel
- All component implementations within a story can run in parallel
- All i18n locale copies (ru/kk/tr) can run in parallel
- All Polish tasks (T074-T087) can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T006) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T007-T025)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T006)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T007-T025)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T026-T042)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (T049-T059)
3. Developer A continues with User Story 3 (T043-T048) - quick win, reuses US2 components
4. Developer C continues with User Story 5 (T060-T073)
5. All developers collaborate on Polish phase (T074-T087)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow quickstart.md for development patterns and testing guide
- Reference data-model.md for i18n schema structure
- Reference contracts/ for TypeScript types and interfaces
- Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` frequently
