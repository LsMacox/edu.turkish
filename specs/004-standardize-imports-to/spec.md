# Feature Specification: Standardize Import Paths to Nuxt 4 Conventions

**Feature Branch**: `004-standardize-imports-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Clarified  
**Input**: User description: "Standardize imports to Nuxt 4 conventions, remove custom aliases where possible, use nuxt.config.ts alias key properly"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the edu.turkish codebase, I need all module imports to follow Nuxt 4's official conventions so that the codebase is consistent, maintainable, and leverages Nuxt's built-in auto-import capabilities without relying on custom aliases unless absolutely necessary.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the codebase uses various import patterns, **When** I review any file, **Then** all imports follow Nuxt 4 conventions with `#imports` for Nuxt auto-imports and `~/` for explicit imports
2. **Given** I'm importing a component, composable, or utility, **When** Nuxt can auto-import it, **Then** no explicit import statement exists
3. **Given** I'm importing from `lib/`, `server/`, or type definitions, **When** I need an explicit import, **Then** the import uses the `~/` alias
4. **Given** the test suite exists, **When** tests import modules, **Then** test imports are compatible with the testing environment and use appropriate aliases
5. **Given** the nuxt.config.ts file, **When** custom aliases are needed, **Then** they are defined in the `alias` configuration key following Nuxt 4 patterns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a module needs to be imported in both auto-import and explicit contexts?
- How does the system handle imports in test files that don't have access to Nuxt's auto-import?
- What happens with circular dependencies when refactoring imports?
- How are server-side imports handled differently from client-side imports?

### Migration & Validation Strategy

**Migration Approach**: Big-bang refactor - all files will be updated in a single PR to ensure consistency and avoid mixed import patterns during transition.

**Validation Requirements**:

- TypeScript type checking must pass (`tsc --noEmit`)
- ESLint validation must pass with no import-related errors
- Full Vitest test suite must pass (all existing tests)
- Manual code review to verify import pattern consistency

**Test Configuration**: Vitest will use the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin (already in package.json) to resolve `~/` aliases in test files, maintaining consistency with the main codebase.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST use Nuxt 4's auto-import feature for all components, composables, and utilities that Nuxt can automatically detect
- **FR-002**: System MUST use `~/` alias for explicit imports from the project root (app/, server/, lib/, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT use custom TypeScript path aliases (like `@/`) unless Nuxt's built-in aliases are insufficient
- **FR-004**: System MUST configure any necessary custom aliases in nuxt.config.ts using the `alias` key
- **FR-005**: Test files MUST use import patterns compatible with Vitest while maintaining consistency with the main codebase
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain proper import resolution for all existing functionality without breaking changes
- **FR-007**: All imports MUST be verifiable through TypeScript type checking and ESLint validation
- **FR-008**: Import patterns MUST be consistent across all file types (Vue components, TypeScript files, test files)
- **FR-009**: Migration MUST be completed as a single atomic refactor (big-bang approach) to avoid mixed import patterns
- **FR-010**: Vitest MUST be configured with vite-tsconfig-paths plugin to resolve `~/` aliases in test files
- **FR-011**: All validation gates (TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, manual review) MUST pass before merge

### Key Entities

- **Import Statement**: A line of code that brings external modules, components, or utilities into a file; can be auto-imported (implicit) or explicit
- **Nuxt Auto-import**: Nuxt 4's built-in capability to automatically import components from `components/`, composables from `composables/`, and utilities without explicit import statements
- **Alias Configuration**: Path mapping defined in nuxt.config.ts that provides shorthand references to directories (e.g., `~/` maps to project root)
- **Test Import Pattern**: Import statements used in test files that must work with Vitest's module resolution while maintaining consistency
