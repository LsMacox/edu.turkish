## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 3.1: Analysis & Data Extraction

**Goal**: Identify which direction slugs are actually used and gather translation data

- [x] **T001** Scan all university JSON files in `app/assets/json/universities/*.json` to extract unique `direction_slug` values from `programs[]` and `directions[]` arrays. Create a list of ~25 unique slugs. Output to temporary file or console for verification.

- [x] **T002** Load existing i18n translation files (`i18n/locales/{en,ru,kk,tr}/directions.json`) and create a mapping structure: `{ [slug]: { en: "...", ru: "...", kk: "...", tr: "..." } }` for all slugs found in T001. Verify all 4 locales have translations for each slug.

- [x] **T003** Validate data completeness: Ensure every slug from T001 has translations in all 4 locales from T002. Report any missing translations. If any are missing, add placeholder translations or source from existing hardcoded data.

---

## Phase 3.2: Implementation

**Goal**: Create seed file and update dependent code

- [x] **T004** [P] Create `prisma/seed/study-directions.ts` with:
  - Import Prisma client
  - Define `DirectionSeedData` type with slug and translations structure
  - Create array of seed data using results from T001-T003
  - Implement `seedStudyDirections(prisma)` function that:
    - Iterates through seed data
    - For each direction: upserts StudyDirection record
    - For each locale: upserts StudyDirectionTranslation with slug, name, description
  - Export the seeder function
  - File path: `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/prisma/seed/study-directions.ts`

- [x] **T005** Update `prisma/seed/seed.ts`:
  - Import `seedStudyDirections` from `./study-directions`
  - Add seeding call BEFORE locations (directions should be seeded early)
  - Add console log: `'ðŸ“š Seeding study directions...'`
  - Update deletion order in development mode to include study direction tables
  - File path: `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/prisma/seed/seed.ts`

- [x] **T006** [P] Update `scripts/import-university.ts`:
  - Remove import of `DirectionSlug` and `ALL_DIRECTIONS` from line 22
  - Remove `DirectionSlugZ` Zod enum definition (line 27)
  - Change `direction_slug: DirectionSlugZ.optional()` to `direction_slug: z.string().optional()` (line 42)
  - Change `directions: z.array(DirectionSlugZ).optional()` to `directions: z.array(z.string()).optional()` (line 210)
  - Remove `getDirectionNames()` function (lines 582-595) and its cache variable
  - Simplify `ensureDirectionAndTranslation()` to not use fallback i18n file reading
  - Update type guards to use `typeof val === 'string'` instead of enum check
  - File path: `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/scripts/import-university.ts`

- [x] **T007** [P] Update `app/assets/json/universities/types.ts`:
  - Remove import of `DirectionSlug` and `ALL_DIRECTIONS` from line 10
  - Change `direction_slug?: DirectionSlug` to `direction_slug?: string` (line 225)
  - Change `directions?: DirectionSlug[]` to `directions?: string[]` (line 320)
  - Remove export of `ALLOWED_DIRECTIONS` (line 333)
  - File path: `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/app/assets/json/universities/types.ts`

- [x] **T008** [P] Create test file `tests/seed/study-directions.test.ts`:
  - Import Prisma client and test utilities (Vitest)
  - Test: "should seed all directions from university JSONs"
  - Test: "should create translations for all 4 locales"
  - Test: "should have unique slugs per locale"
  - Test: "should match direction slugs used in university files"
  - Use actual database or mock Prisma client
  - File path: `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/tests/seed/study-directions.test.ts`

---

## Phase 3.3: Cleanup

**Goal**: Remove hardcoded files and run seed

- [x] **T009** Remove hardcoded TypeScript file:
- - Delete `app/types/directions.ts`
- Verify no other files import from this path (search codebase for `from.*directions` or `@/types/directions`)
- File path: `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/app/types/directions.ts`

- [x] **T010** Remove hardcoded i18n direction files:
  - Delete `i18n/locales/en/directions.json`
  - Delete `i18n/locales/ru/directions.json`
  - Delete `i18n/locales/kk/directions.json`
  - Delete `i18n/locales/tr/directions.json`
  - Verify no code references these files
  - File paths: `/home/lsmacox/projects/edu.turkish/i18n/locales/{en,ru,kk,tr}/directions.json`

- [x] **T011** Run database seed and verify:
  - Execute `npm run db:reset` (or `npm run db:seed` if data should be preserved)
  - Verify console output shows study directions seeded successfully
  - Open Prisma Studio (`npx prisma studio`) and verify:
    - `study_directions` table has ~25 records
    - `study_direction_translations` table has ~100 records (25 Ã— 4)
    - Each direction has all 4 locale translations
  - Test import script: `npx tsx scripts/import-university.ts app/assets/json/universities/istanbul_aydin_university.json`

---

## Phase 3.4: Validation

**Goal**: Ensure everything works without hardcoded files

- [x] **T012** Run TypeScript type check:
  - Execute `npm run typecheck` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`)
  - Verify no compilation errors
  - Verify no import errors for removed `DirectionSlug` type
  - Fix any remaining type issues if found
  - Expected: Clean build with 0 errors

- [ ] **T013** Run all existing tests:
  - Execute `npm run test`
  - Verify all tests pass (including new seed test from T008)
  - If any tests fail due to direction-related changes, update them
  - Expected: All tests green

- [ ] **T014** Execute quickstart manual validation:
  - Follow steps in `specs/002-remove-hardcoded-directions/quickstart.md`
  - Start dev server: `npm run dev`
  - Navigate to universities page and verify direction filters work
  - Check university detail pages show correct directions
  - Test locale switching for direction names (en, ru, kk, tr)
  - Verify no console errors
  - Complete all 8 success criteria checkboxes in quickstart.md

**Parallel Opportunities**:

- T004, T006, T007, T008 can run in parallel (different files)
- T009, T010 can run in parallel (different files)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2: Implementation Tasks (After T003)

```bash
# Launch T004, T006, T007, T008 together:
Task: "Create prisma/seed/study-directions.ts with seed data and upsert logic"
Task: "Update scripts/import-university.ts to remove DirectionSlug validation"
Task: "Update app/assets/json/universities/types.ts to use string instead of DirectionSlug"
Task: "Create tests/seed/study-directions.test.ts with seed validation tests"

# Then T005 (depends on T004):
Task: "Update prisma/seed/seed.ts to call seedStudyDirections"
```

### Phase 3.3: Cleanup Tasks

```bash
# Launch T009, T010 together:
Task: "Delete app/types/directions.ts"
Task: "Delete i18n/locales/{en,ru,kk,tr}/directions.json files"
```

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **No new API endpoints** - this is a backend refactor only
- **No schema changes** - tables already exist in database
- **No UI changes** - frontend continues to work with same data contracts
- Commit after completing each phase
- Run `npm run typecheck` frequently during implementation

---
