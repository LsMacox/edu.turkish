## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a consultant working in a specific EspoCRM team, I want to receive instant Telegram notifications when new leads are created or when call activities are logged, so that I can respond quickly to potential customers and track my team's activities in real-time without constantly checking the CRM system.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new lead is created in EspoCRM and assigned to a consultant who is a member of the designated team, **When** the lead is saved, **Then** a notification with lead details is sent to the Leads Telegram channel

2. **Given** a new call activity is logged in EspoCRM by a consultant who is a member of the designated team, **When** the call activity is saved, **Then** a notification with call details is sent to the Call Activities Telegram channel

3. **Given** a new lead is created in EspoCRM and assigned to a consultant who is NOT a member of the designated team, **When** the lead is saved, **Then** no notification is sent to any Telegram channel

4. **Given** a new call activity is logged by a consultant who is NOT a member of the designated team, **When** the call activity is saved, **Then** no notification is sent to any Telegram channel

5. **Given** a lead or call activity is created without any team assignment, **When** the record is saved, **Then** notification is sent (simplified approach - no complex filtering)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Telegram bot is unavailable or the channel is inaccessible? ‚Üí System retries up to 3 times, then logs error
- What happens if EspoCRM webhook fails or times out? ‚Üí Webhook returns error to EspoCRM, notification queued for retry
- How does the system handle rapid creation of multiple leads/calls? ‚Üí Each notification processed independently through queue
