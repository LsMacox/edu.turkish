# Feature Specification: CDN Asset Delivery

**Feature Branch**: `007-cdn-replacement-for`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "давай круто реализуем замену картинок/видео по пути public/images/universities и public/images/reviews и public/videos/reviews на наш cdn. Вот пример для получения картинок из каталога public/images/reviews -> https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/images/reviews для videos -> https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/videos/reviews для universities https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/images/universities логику ты понял. Мне не нужно мапять конкретно, просто для примера скинул"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ Feature description provided: CDN replacement for static assets
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: End users, content consumers
   → Actions: Load images/videos from CDN instead of local server
   → Data: Static media assets (images, videos) from public directory
   → Constraints: Flexible path mapping, no fallback needed
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → ✅ All clarified by user
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ User flow clear: transparent asset loading
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ Requirements testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   → ✅ Asset types identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✅ All checks passed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a website visitor, when I browse university pages or review sections, I want all images and videos to load quickly and reliably from a content delivery network, so that I experience fast page loads regardless of my geographic location.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits a page with static assets, **When** the page loads images/videos from `/public/` directory, **Then** the assets are served from CDN with path `https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/` + relative path
2. **Given** a university page loads an image at `/images/universities/logo.png`, **When** the URL is transformed, **Then** it becomes `https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/images/universities/logo.png`
3. **Given** a review page loads a video at `/videos/reviews/tour.mp4`, **When** the URL is transformed, **Then** it becomes `https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/videos/reviews/tour.mp4`
4. **Given** any public asset path, **When** CDN transformation is applied, **Then** the path structure is preserved and only the base URL changes

### Edge Cases

- What happens with assets that have query parameters or special characters in filenames?
- How does the system handle different asset types (images, videos, documents)?
- What happens with dynamically generated asset paths?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a flexible mechanism to transform any `/public/` asset path to CDN URL
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve the complete path structure when transforming to CDN (e.g., `/images/reviews/photo.jpg` → `https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/images/reviews/photo.jpg`)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support transformation for any asset type (images, videos, documents) without hardcoded directory mappings
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow developers to easily apply CDN transformation to any public asset path
- **FR-005**: System MUST use CDN base URL `https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/` as the root for all transformed assets
- **FR-006**: System MUST NOT implement fallback logic - CDN is the single source of truth for assets
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all existing asset formats, dimensions, and quality levels
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle edge cases like query parameters and special characters in filenames

### Key Entities

- **Public Assets**: Any static files (images, videos, documents) served from the `/public/` directory, including but not limited to university images, review media, and other static content.
- **CDN Base URL**: The root URL for the content delivery network (`https://cdn.edu-turkish.com/`), which mirrors the structure of local public assets.
- **Asset Path**: The relative path from `/public/` directory that is preserved when transforming to CDN URL.
