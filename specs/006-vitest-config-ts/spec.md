## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the edu.turkish project, I need all test suites to run reliably without external dependencies, with clear structure and minimal boilerplate, so that I can quickly verify code changes and maintain high code quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a test suite requiring database access, **When** tests execute, **Then** database interactions are mocked without requiring actual Prisma/Postgres containers
2. **Given** a test suite requiring Redis cache, **When** tests execute, **Then** Redis operations are mocked without requiring actual Redis containers
3. **Given** any test file in the suite, **When** developer reads the test, **Then** test structure is clear with AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) and no excessive comments
4. **Given** the updated vitest.config.ts configuration, **When** tests run, **Then** all path aliases and auto-imports work correctly
5. **Given** test-utils module is implemented, **When** writing new tests, **Then** common mocking patterns are available as reusable utilities

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a test requires both database and Redis mocks simultaneously?
- How does the system handle component tests that depend on Nuxt auto-imports?
- What happens when a test needs to simulate external API failures?
- How are i18n translations mocked without loading actual locale files?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST execute without requiring external Docker containers (Postgres, Redis, etc.)
- **FR-002**: Test suite MUST provide mock utilities for database operations through test-utils module
- **FR-003**: Test suite MUST provide mock utilities for Redis/cache operations through test-utils module
- **FR-004**: All tests MUST follow a consistent, clear structure without excessive comments
- **FR-005**: Test-utils module MUST export reusable mocks for Nuxt composables (useI18n, $fetch, etc.)
- **FR-006**: Tests MUST work with vitest.config.ts configuration for path resolution and auto-imports
- **FR-007**: Component tests MUST handle Nuxt auto-imports correctly
- **FR-008**: Repository tests MUST mock Prisma client without real database connections
- **FR-009**: Integration tests dependent on external services MUST use mocks instead of real connections
- **FR-010**: Test structure MUST be intuitive and self-documenting

### Key Entities

- **Test-Utils Module**: Centralized testing utilities providing mocks for database, cache, Nuxt composables, and common test scenarios
- **Mock Database Client**: Simulated Prisma client for repository tests without database dependency
- **Mock Redis Client**: Simulated Redis client for cache-dependent tests
- **Mock Composables**: Reusable mocks for Nuxt auto-imported functions (useI18n, $fetch, useNuxtApp, etc.)
- **Test Fixtures**: Reusable test data generators for common entities (users, universities, applications, etc.)
